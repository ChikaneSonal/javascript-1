✨ **Excited to Share My First JavaScript Project!** ✨  

As I dive deeper into web development, I’ve completed my very first project using **JavaScript**, and I couldn’t be more thrilled! 🎉  

🔹 **What I Built:**  
An **interactive webpage** where the image dynamically changes based on user interactions like:  
➡️ **Clicking** a button  
➡️ **Double-clicking**  
➡️ **Hovering** over the image  

🔹 **Key Highlights:**  
✅ Learned to use **JavaScript event listeners**  
✅ Applied **DOM manipulation** techniques  
✅ Integrated **conditional logic** for a responsive UI  
✅ Added smooth transitions and animations using **CSS**  

This project has been a great stepping stone in my journey as a web developer, helping me bring interactivity to my designs. 🚀  

I’m excited to keep learning and creating more! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. 😊
